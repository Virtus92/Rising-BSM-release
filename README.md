## Architecture

Rising BSM follows a modern architecture based on modular design principles and clean architecture. The codebase is organized into several key modules:

### Core Structure

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/             # Static assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                # Source code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/            # Next.js app router pages and layouts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Core framework and infrastructure
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/         # Domain models and business interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/       # Feature modules
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/         # Shared components and utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma/             # Prisma ORM schema and migrations
```

### Key Modules

- **Core**: Foundation services, utilities, and abstractions
- **Domain**: Business entities, interfaces, and contracts
- **Features**: Implementation of business capabilities
- **Shared**: Reusable components and utilities

For more details on the architecture, see the [Architecture Documentation](#architecture).

- `domain/dtos/`: Data transfer object types
- `domain/entities/`: Domain entity types
- `domain/repositories/`: Repository interface types
- `domain/services/`: Service interface types

### Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Follow the installation steps above
2. **Develop**: Make changes to the codebase
3. **Test**: Run tests to verify changes
4. **Build**: Build the application for production
5. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to your hosting environment

## API Reference
